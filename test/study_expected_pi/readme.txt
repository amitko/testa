Study of the stability ot the estimation parameters based on
the estimation of the expected probability for correct item
performance.

A number of items are senerated for different values of the
expected performance. This should be done using both generation
based on IRT and generation as Bernoulli trials.


Their parameters are estimated using 3PL ML and then the expected
item performance is calculated, based on the IRT parameters.
